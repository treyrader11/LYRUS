<h2>Web App That Searches Lyrics, Videos, and Information on Artists</h2>

<p>A project that brings everything I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX in a single capstone project, an API hack.</p>
<p>An experience researching RESTful APIs and designing client-side applications to interface with them, and see a project through from ideation to implementation.</p>
<h3>Capstone Project Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The application must make use of a third-party API and use the results to change the DOM.You will need to choose the API you wish to use and how you will use the data.</li>
	<li>You must plan your app in detail before you start building. Send the sketch to your mentor so he or she can flag potential problems with it – such as data limits or technology requirements – before you start building.</li>
	<li>Try making your project responsive using media queries, as you learned in unit 1.</li>
</ul>
