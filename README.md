Primarily designed for mobile devices, I decided to create an app that conveniences users to retrieve information regarding music, new or old, without having to research from various web apps. With LRYUS, you can find the lyrics, videos, and brief wiki snippets of your favorite artists. The best thing about it is that you can stream YouTube videos without having to sit through all of the unsolicited ads.
